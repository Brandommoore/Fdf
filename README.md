## FDF

Fdf is a project that tries to render a map in isometric perspective from a plain text format in which only the height and/or color reference points are found. Works with MinilibX library from 42 and OpenGL.

An example of the program is this. There is the map, and the rendered map on a window.

``` bash
42_map.fdf:
